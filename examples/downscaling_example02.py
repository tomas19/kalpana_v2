'''
Example for doing the static downscaling using an existing grass location, and importing
the DEM with the mesh elements size. Both inputs were created in the example_01.
There is a short description of all inputs below, more detail can be found in the
docstring of the function in the github repository.

ncFile = r'/home/kalpana/maxele.63.nc'
## contour levels to use in the downscaling
## from 0 to 11 (included) every 1
levels = [0, 11, 1]
## output CRS
epsgOut = 6543
## full path for the shape file with the maxele contours
## same path is used for saving rasters and the grass location

## version of grass 8.2 and 8.3 works
grassVer = 8.3
## path of the downscaling rasters

## rasters filenames, can be a list if more than one. 
## 'all' for importing ALL THE FILES in pathRasFiles 
rasterFiles = 'ncDEMs_epsg6543'
## full path of the raster with the mesh element size

## crs of adcirc output (default value)

## vertical unit of the maxele

## name of the maxele variable to downscale. Always 'zeta_max' for downscaling
var = 'zeta_max'
## contours type. Always 'polygon' for downscaling
conType = 'polygon'
## full path of file (kml, kmz, shp or gpkg) to crop the domain.
subDomain = None
## boolean for exporting the mesh as a shape file from maxele, not necessary in this
## case since mesh was exported as preprocess. In example_03 it is exported.

## full path of pickle file with vertical datum differences for all mesh nodes
## proprocess step
dzFile = r'/home/kalpana/NC9mesh_from_tss2navd88.pkl'
## threshold to do apply the vertical datum difference, below -20 vyperdatum gives weird
## results
zeroDif = -20
## full path of the grass location if a existing one will be used
## if None a new location called 'grassLoc' is created. A new location is created in
## example_03
nameGrassLocation = 'grassLoc'
## Boolean for creating grass location, in this example it was created as a preprocess
## step. In example_03 it is created.
createGrassLocation = False
## Method for assigning the crs to the grass location. Default and faster option

## variable to downscale, can be 'zMax', 'zMean' and 'zMin'. With 'zMean', the mean value
## of each contour is used.

## define clumpling threshold from mesh

## percentage of the minimum element area to scale the clumping threshold

## export downscaled results as shape files. Slows down the process a couple of minutes
ras2vec = False
## boolean for exporing raw maxele as a DEM. Useful for debugging
