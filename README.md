Kalpana is a python module that converts ADCIRC output files to shapefiles and KMZ files. It is capable of converting time-varying outputs such as the significant wave height and time-constant outputs such as the maximum water elevation into polylines or polygons in both of the recently mentioned formats.
Kalpana was built by Rosemary Cyriac, and her efforts were aided by the initial attempts of Rich Signell (USGS) and Rusty Holleman to generate shapefiles from ADCIRC results. Jason Fleming improved Kalpana and incorporated the code into ADCIRC Surge Guidance System (ASGS) that he maintains at the Renaissance Computing Institute (RENCI). 
Kalpana was rewritten in python 3 and using GeoPandas as the core python package by Tom√°s Cuevas (tacuevas@ncsu.edu).
