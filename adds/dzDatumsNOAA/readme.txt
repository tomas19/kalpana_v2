We downloaded tide measurements from all the stations in the link below for the year 2022 in MSL and NAVD88, using the NOAA api. Then we averaged each time series and computed the difference between both datums.The file has the vertical difference between MSL and NAVD88 (MSL - NAVD88) for 354 stations.
